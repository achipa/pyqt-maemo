Switched the build system to Qt v4.6.0.


2009/12/01  9:32:52  phil

Fixed the argument type of QClipboard.connectNotify().


2009/11/15 14:01:31  phil

Added support for docstrings for new-style signals.


2009/11/11 21:03:33  phil

broke the installation of the uic module.


2009/10/28 22:13:49  phil

Added support for out-of-tree building (for standard builds).


2009/10/28 10:46:14  phil

were breaking the puzzle.py examples.


2009/10/28  7:49:23  phil

Fixed a bug in the handling of unknown Qt property or signal.
Documented support for keyword arguments.


2009/10/26 12:20:34  phil

a problem on Windows).


2009/10/20 11:58:07  phil
Hopefully finally fixed the regression where slot proxies were being deleted
too soon when disconnect() was called from within the slot.  (With much help
from Hans-Peter Jansen.)


2009/10/14 16:19:06  phil
Eliminated the compiler warning messages related to qDebug() and friends.
A number of private copy ctors added manually (and temporarily) to allow
building against Qt v4.6.0-beta1.


2009/10/13  8:44:03  phil
Fixed a pyuic bug with QHeaderView.setSortIndicatorShown().

Fixed a premature delete that affected QTimer.singleShot().


2009/10/09  6:14:41  phil
Reverted the /Constrained/ annotation on QClipboard.text() for the QString v1
API as a mutable QString is only needed if the initial value is null.
Therefore allowing an ordinary string won't lose information.


2009/10/07 22:37:06  phil
Added the missing QGraphicsSceneDragDropEvent.setDropAction().


2009/10/07 18:05:59  phil

one the emitter is in.


2009/10/07 17:09:56  phil

Added a missing cast (needed by MinGW) to the QString conversion code.


2009/09/18  9:36:13  phil
Added widthChar() and boundingRectChar() to QFontMetrics and QFontMetricsF for
v2 of the QString API.  These are needed because width() and boundingRect()
give different results for a QChar and a QString of length one.


2009/09/17 22:06:02  phil
Made the width() and boundingRect() QChar overloads specific to v2 of the
QString API.


2009/09/17 19:13:22  phil
Reenabled the QChar overloads of the width() and boundingRect() methods of
QFontMetrics and QFontMetricsF as they are not the equivalent of a single
character QString.


2009/09/17  9:40:03  phil
Invalid keyword arguments to a QObject ctor now raise an exception (as they do
with pyqtConfigure()).


2009/09/16 15:06:38  phil
Documented the additional QVariant incompatibility that it no longer keeps a
reference to QObject instances.


2009/09/14 12:12:49  phil
Further fixes for Snow Leopard on 64 bit systems.
Added QObject.pyqtConfigure().


2009/09/12 17:39:10  phil
Fixed pyuic4 for the minimum width and height for columns and rows, and column
and row spacing.


2009/09/12 13:28:05  phil
configure.py no longer assumes that an explicit architecture means a universal
binary.


2009/09/12  3:10:03  phil
Added the --use-arch command line option to configure to force MacOS python to
use a particular architecture.
Added missing operating system names (Snow Leopard and Windows 7).

Fixed a couple of bugs in the samplebuffers.py example.


2009/09/06 22:32:02  phil

Changes needed by SIP's extended assignment helper functionality.


2009/09/02 20:33:00  phil
Added the /Array/ and /ArraySize/ annotations to the drawLines(),
drawPoints(), drawPolygon() and drawRects() methods of QPaintEngine (although
SIP doesn't support them yet).


2009/08/23 12:56:29  phil
Fixed the line numbers in .ts files.


2009/08/21 18:52:28  phil
Fixed pylupdate's broken handling of Python comments.


2009/08/21 14:57:40  phil
Added a missing /Transfer/ to QSyntaxHighlighter.setCurrentBlockUserData().


2009/08/19  8:00:42  phil
Fixed the QString buffer protocol implementation for Python v2.x built with
UCS4 support.


2009/08/18 16:50:37  phil
Added a missing /Transfer/ to QTreeWidget.setItemWidget().


2009/08/18 16:33:29  phil
pyuic now uses the Python implementation of ElementTree so that it handles
XML provided in a StringIO.


2009/08/11 14:34:17  phil
Fixed QGraphicsLinearLayout.removeAt() as Qt doesn't always return ownership
to the caller as the documentation claims.


2009/08/11 13:41:52  phil
Removed the remaining calls to deleteLater() in the slot/signal proxy code.


2009/08/11 12:16:24  phil
Fixed a similar regression.


2009/08/11 11:48:03  phil
Fixed a regression introduced when getting the QVariant v2 API working with Qt
registered meta-types.


2009/08/11 11:36:22  phil
Signal/slot proxies are now deleted as soon as possible to reduce the use of
deleteLater().


2009/08/10 19:34:15  phil
Minor improvements to the storing of proxy slot objects.


2009/08/09 22:29:12  phil
QAbstractFileEngine, QTextDecoder, QTextEncoder and QSqlResult now have
sip.wrapper as their super-type as they all can be returned by virtual
factories which use the object ownership infrastructure.


2009/08/08 21:41:19  phil
Use memcpy() instead of Py_UNICODE_COPY() because Py_MEMCPY() is broken on
Windows with C++.


2009/08/08 18:43:11  phil
Updated the demos examples for the QString v2 API.


2009/08/08 18:20:03  phil

greater than 0xffff when Python is built with --enable-unicode=ucs4.


2009/08/05 19:26:45  phil

2009/08/04 15:49:18  phil
Fixed the validate methods of QAbstractSpinBox, QDateTimeEdit, QDoubleSpinBox,
QDoubleValidator, QIntValidator, QRegExpValidator, QSpinBox and QValidator for
v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/04 14:28:35  phil

2009/08/04 13:03:07  phil
Fixed QClipboard for the QString v2 API.


2009/08/04 12:43:48  phil
Added the getOpenFileNameAndFilter(), getOpenFileNamesAndFilter() and
getSaveFileNameAndFilter() static methods to QFileDialog.
The getOpenFileName(), getOpenFileNames() and getSaveFileName() static methods
of QFileDialog don't take a mutable QString argument to return the selected
filter for v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/04  0:28:01  phil
Fixed QWebPage.javaScriptPrompt() for the v2 QString API.


2009/08/03 16:14:36  phil

2009/08/02 21:31:45  phil
qt_set_sequence_auto_mnemonic() is now OS/X specific.


2009/08/02 21:09:50  phil
v2 of the QString API now converts between a null QString and None.


2009/08/02 19:02:18  phil
Removed overloads of QXmlQuery.evaluateTo() that take pointers to QStringList
and QString as they won't work with the v2 QString API.  If anybody notices we
can implement something with handwritten code.


2009/08/02 18:16:33  phil
Added the v2 implementation of QStringList.


2009/08/02 16:20:16  phil
Removed the qwt.py plugin for pyuic as one is now included with PyQwt.


2009/08/02 15:39:24  phil
A QLatin1String can now be passed whenever a QString is expected.
Removed all overloads that took a QLatin1String where there is an equivalent
that takes a QString (ie. all of them).
Removed QLatin1String from the v2 QString API.


2009/08/02 14:47:58  phil
Removed QLatin1Char from the QString v2 API.


2009/08/02 14:28:29  phil
Added the v2 API support for QChar.
Removed the fromUnicode() and convertFromUnicode() methods that take an array
of QChar from QTextCodec.  This means an incompatibility as QTextCodec is now
abstract and cannot be sub-classed - but doing so before would never have
worked anyway.


2009/08/02 13:45:07  phil
Removed the width() and boundingRect() methods of QFontMetrics and
QFontMetricsF that take QChar arguments as they can be handled by the
overloads that take a QString.

Removed QStringMatcher from v2 of the QString API.


2009/08/01 22:03:55  phil

2009/07/27 19:03:52  phil
Fixed the super-class for QGLContext as it takes part in parent/child
relationships.


2009/07/24 17:27:18  phil
Fixed the highlightedtextedit.py example.
configure.py gives precedence to the directory containing sip.h to that
containing Python.h (as the latter may include a distro supplied sip.h).


2009/07/20 11:39:23  phil
QVariant.toPyObject() now recurses through any collections.


2009/07/17 13:57:55  phil

Added the static functions to the QVariant v2 API.


2009/07/07 10:56:13  phil
Applied the new /AllowNone/ annotation to the v1 implementation of QVariant.
Changed fetchmore.py, simpledommodel.py and simpletreemodel.py as they are now
independent of the QVariant API.


2009/07/06 20:03:32  phil
Converted the application.py, mdi.py, recentfiles.py and sdi.py examples to
the QVariant v2 API.


2009/07/06 19:42:26  phil

Fixed a regression in converting Python objects to QVariant containers.


2009/06/22 20:34:19  phil

Fixed a pyuic bug handling spacers in QFormLayouts.


2009/06/22 16:47:28  phil
Documented the QVariant API versions.

Implemented the QTextStream API to handle the bin(), hex() and oct() name
clashes.


2009/06/18 11:43:33  phil
Implemented the different __hash__ APIs.


2009/06/17 11:58:30  phil
Added the %API directive defaulting to v2 for Python3 and v1 for Python2.
SIP v4.9 is now required.


2009/06/17 11:44:10  phil
Merged v4.5.1 into the trunk.


2009/06/16  9:32:22  phil
Released as v4.5.1.


2009/06/16  9:21:01  phil
Only convert exact dicts to a QVariantMap and back and not dict sub-classes.


2009/06/14 14:57:37  phil
Removed an assertion when building dynamic meta-objects, instead just ignore
the attribute if it doesn't have the expected type.


2009/06/13 11:29:17  phil
Fixed the handling of QWizard by pyuic.


2009/06/12 17:28:44  phil
Changed the SIP dependency to v4.8.1 (not necessary but we don't want it to
survive in the wild).
Changed the roadmap to show how incompatible APIs will be selected.


2009/06/12  9:09:41  phil
Fixed __str__ for QByteArray for Python v3 so it is consistent with Python v2.


2009/06/12  8:23:23  phil
Reverted the roadmap change about __hash__ being an incompatibile change.  The
issue isn't that the hash function has changed (which isn't considered a
compatibility problem) it's that different objects that previously had a
different hash value (based on their id()) now might have the same hash value.


2009/06/11 22:16:19  phil
Updated the roadmap to show that the __hash__ additions (including QUrl) are
not now considered incompatible changes.

Added the missing setCoordinateMode() and coordinateMode() methods from
QGradient.


2009/06/05  9:40:16  phil
Released as v4.5.


2009/06/04 22:36:11  phil
Another (final) go at fixing QAbstractItemModel.createIndex().


2009/06/04 21:38:38  phil
Changed the implementation of QModelIndex.internalId() to match that of the
id() builtin - and let Python handle the portabilty issues.


2009/06/04 18:05:02  phil
Removed the /KeepReference/ annotation from QAbstractItemModel.createIndex()
as the extra reference should really be associated with the returned
QModelIndex.


2009/06/04 14:53:46  phil
Hopefully finally fixed QModel.internalId() and
QAbstractItemModel.createIndex() for all platforms.


2009/06/03 22:29:54  phil
Treat QModelIndex.internalId() and a quint64 rather than qint64.


2009/06/03 17:12:23  phil
Use the Qt v4.2.0 and later version of QAbstractItemModel.createIndex().


2009/06/01 14:31:16  phil
Backed out QFlags.testFlag() because of some problem with PyKDE4 (and no time
to investigate further).


2009/06/01 10:17:36  phil
QVector<unsigned> now creates Python long objects to ensure values stay
unsigned on 32 bit systems.

Added the graphicssystems plugins to the Windows installer.


2009/05/27 13:25:58  phil
Some fixes for the OpenGL examples from Francis Cho.


2009/05/26 23:42:52  phil
Added support for QWizard and QWizardPage to pyuic.


2009/05/26 15:15:30  phil

2009/05/20 11:27:41  phil
QVariant.toPyObject() now raises an exception if the QVariant is invalid.


2009/05/18  0:14:02  phil
Fixed a deadlock between the GIL and Qt's internal thread mutex when a slot
proxy is calling QObject::sender() while holding the GIL.

Removed a couple of compiler warning messages.


2009/05/06 15:00:47  phil
Fixed a configure.py bug that meant the DBus detection was broken.


2009/05/04 19:02:00  phil
Fixed bugs in the Designer plugin example widgets introduced when converting to
the new signal API.


2009/05/04 16:49:16  phil
Fixed a silly configure.py bug related to the new -py3 pyrcc flag.


2009/05/04 15:49:09  phil
Had second thoughts about pyrcc4 and added the -py2 flag and made it the
default.


2009/05/04 15:26:51  phil

2009/05/02  9:53:03  phil
Added some unit tests that (hopefully) prove that the recent Chimera changes
don't affect Python sub-classes.


2009/05/01 15:30:21  phil
Chimera now handles all QWidget and QObject sub-classes as QWidgetStar and
QObjectStar (not just QWidget and QObject themselves).


2009/05/01 14:13:20  phil
Reinstanted QString(const QByteArray &) now that a QByteArray isn't
automatically converted to a QString.


2009/05/01  9:39:52  phil
In Python v3, Chimera now handles bytes and bytearray objects as QByteArrays
rather then QStrings.


2009/04/30 22:11:06  phil
Explicity set %DefaultSupertype in each module now that it doesn't affect
importing modules.

Fixed the issue with Assistant and the new qtdemo.
Fixed some of the example READMEs to make sure they had at least three
